# Remote-Healthcare-Monitoring-System

A Remote health monitoring system is an extension of a hospital medical system where a patientâ€™s vital body state can be monitored remotely. The system can be applied in the scenarios if, a patient is known to have a medical condition with unstable regulatory body system.

To develop the above-mentioned system, we will provide the patient with a unique channel id/ patient ID. The patient can self-monitor using the device and the doctor can advise the patient accordingly by remotely checking the vitals by logging into the patient ID on a dedicated portal. This will prevent any kind of physical contact and the diagnosis is done at home itself.
